Modern systems are becoming more and more complex and sophisticated in their demand for performance, reliability and increasing autonomy. Historically, highly analytic and numeric-based methods have sufficed, frequently simplifying the problem to allow analytical tractability. Many manufactured and natural systems (biological, ecological and socio-economic) cannot be adequately represented or analyzed without requiring multiple interacting and interconnected frameworks and a common information-processing framework. A wide range of new theories, methodologies and techniques are required to ‘enable’ such systems, and thus engineering and integration to deal with these demands. IJSS therefore encourages original submissions in these areas, with special focus on papers that are strongly novel as well as not being overly applied. Proposals for special issues in cutting-edge areas of systems science are encouraged, and should be discussed with the Editor-in-Chief. Papers that cover those topics related to operations management and logistics will not be accepted for publication in IJSS.

ECONOMIC SYSTEMS,ELSEVIER,3.3,Q1,No,"Economic Systems is a refereed journal for the analysis of causes and consequences of the significant institutional variety prevailing among all developed, developing, emerging, and transition economies, as well as attempts at and proposals for their reform. The journal is open to micro and macro contributions, theoretical as well as empirical, the latter to analyze related topics against the background of country or region-specific experiences. This is to reflect the respective new orientation within the field of comparative economics: decades of development and transition experience in many countries have clearly demonstrated the importance of institutions and institutional change for the functioning of markets and the ways in which policies influence economic activity in general and economic growth in particular. However, we believe that institutional development is only one of the important factors in affecting domestic and global economies. Hence, Economic Systems strongly encourages submissions from all other fields, covering, but not limited to, a variety of aspects of financial and economic systems and development, including private and state banking; goods and services and financial markets; macro and micro policies and their effects; and global trade issues and exchange rate systems in all developed, developing, emerging, and transition economies.

JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A STATISTICS IN SOCIETY,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,1.6,Q2,No,"Series A (Statistics in Society) publishes high quality papers that demonstrate how statistical thinking, design and analyses play a vital role in all walks of life and benefit society in general. There is no restriction on subject-matter: any interesting, topical and revelatory applications of statistics are welcome. For example, important applications of statistical and related data science methodology in medicine, business and commerce, industry, economics and finance, education and teaching, physical and biomedical sciences, the environment, the law, government and politics, demography, psychology, sociology and sport all fall within the journal's remit. The journal is therefore aimed at a wide statistical audience and at professional statisticians in particular. Its emphasis is on well-written and clearly reasoned quantitative approaches to problems in the real world rather than the exposition of technical detail. Thus, although the methodological basis of papers must be sound and adequately explained, methodology per se should not be the main focus of a Series A paper. Of particular interest are papers on topical or contentious statistical issues, papers which give reviews or exposés of current statistical concerns and papers which demonstrate how appropriate statistical thinking has contributed to our understanding of important substantive questions. Historical, professional and biographical contributions are also welcome, as are discussions of methods of data collection and of ethical issues, provided that all such papers have substantial statistical relevance.Join the conversation about this journal","Decision Sciences; Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty; Economics, Econometrics and Finance; Economics and Econometrics; Mathematics; Statistics and Probability; Social Sciences; Social Sciences (miscellaneous)"
JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,3.6,Q1,No,"Series B (Statistical Methodology) aims to publish high quality papers on the methodological aspects of statistics and data science more broadly. The objective of papers should be to contribute to the understanding of statistical methodology and/or to develop and improve statistical methods; any mathematical theory should be directed towards these aims. The kinds of contribution considered include descriptions of new methods of collecting or analysing data, with the underlying theory, an indication of the scope of application and preferably a real example. Also considered are comparisons, critical evaluations and new applications of existing methods, contributions to probability theory which have a clear practical bearing (including the formulation and analysis of stochastic models), statistical computation or simulation where original methodology is involved and original contributions to the foundations of statistical science. Reviews of methodological techniques are also considered. A paper, even if correct and well presented, is likely to be rejected if it only presents straightforward special cases of previously published work, if it is of mathematical interest only, if it is too long in relation to the importance of the new material that it contains or if it is dominated by computations or simulations of a routine nature.Join the conversation about this journal","Decision Sciences; Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty; Mathematics; Statistics and Probability"
JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C APPLIED STATISTICS,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,1.3,Q2,No,"Series C (Applied Statistics) promotes papers that are focused on statistical methods for real life problems. Applications should be central to papers, rather than illustrative, to motivate the work and to justify any methodological developments. All papers should feature an adequate description of a substantial application and a justification for any new theory. Case-studies may be particularly appropriate and should include some contextual details, though there should also be a novel statistical contribution, for instance by adapting or developing methodology, or by demonstrating the proper application of new or existing statistical methods to solve challenging applied problems. Papers describing interdisciplinary work are especially welcome, as are those that give interesting novel applications of existing methodology or provide new insights into the practical application of methods, and papers explaining innovative analysis of generic applied problems but not necessarily focused on a particular application also have a place in Series C. Short communications may also be appropriate. Methodological papers that are not motivated by a genuine application are not acceptable; nor are papers that include only brief numerical illustrations or that mainly describe simulation studies of properties of statistical techniques. However, papers describing developments in statistical computing are encouraged, provided that they are driven by practical examples.

CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,4.6,Q1,No,"Control Engineering Practice strives to meet the needs of industrial practitioners and industrially related academics and researchers. It publishes papers which illustrate the direct application of control theory and its supporting tools in all possible areas of automation. As a result, the journal only contains papers which can be considered to have made significant contributions to the application of advanced control techniques. It is normally expected that practical results should be included, but where simulation only studies are available, it is necessary to demonstrate that the simulation model is representative of a genuine application. Strictly theoretical papers will find a more appropriate home in Control Engineering Practice's sister publication, Automatica. It is also expected that papers are innovative with respect to the state of the art and are sufficiently detailed for a reader to be able to duplicate the main results of the paper (supplementary material, including datasets, tables, code and any relevant interactive material can be made available and downloaded from the website). The benefits of the presented methods must be made very clear and the new techniques must be compared and contrasted with results obtained using existing methods. Moreover, a thorough analysis of failures that may happen in the design process and implementation can also be part of the paper. The scope of Control Engineering Practice matches the activities of IFAC. Papers demonstrating the contribution of automation and control in improving the performance, quality, productivity, sustainability, resource and energy efficiency, and the manageability of systems and processes for the benefit of mankind and are relevant to industrial practitioners are most welcome.Join the conversation about this journal",Computer Science; Computer Science Applications; Engineering; Control and Systems Engineering; Electrical and Electronic Engineering; Mathematics; Applied Mathematics

JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT,WILEY,10.4,Q1,No,"The mission of Journal of Operations Management (JOM) is to publish original, empirical operations management research that demonstrates both academic and practical relevance. Academic relevance means the research contributes to on-going academic discussions and debates on relevant topics in operations management. All manuscripts published in JOM must, in one way or another, also transcend the immediate empirical context in which the research is embedded. An ideal manuscript is one that simultaneously takes the context seriously (is empirically disciplined) and seeks some sense of generality. Practical relevance means the manuscript links explicitly to an actual, relevant managerial challenge. While manuscripts published in JOM do not necessarily have to give advice to managers, they must have something non-obvious to say about the practice of operations management. In preparing your manuscript, ask yourself: Do I think I could keep a manager interested in talking about my research for an hour? What would I say, what would I argue? An ideal manuscript balances rigor with relevance and offers a novel aspect to a topic of contemporary concern. Novelty does not necessarily mean focusing on emerging phenomena, novel approaches to examinations of established phenomena are equally interesting and relevant.Join the conversation about this journal","Business, Management and Accounting; Strategy and Management; Computer Science; Computer Science Applications; Decision Sciences; Management Science and Operations Research; Engineering; Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering"

MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,2.7,Q1,No,"Managerial and Decision Economics will publish articles applying economic reasoning to managerial decision-making and management strategy. Management strategy concerns practical decisions that managers face about how to compete, how to succeed, and how to organize to achieve their goals. Economic thinking and analysis provides a critical foundation for strategic decision-making across a variety of dimensions. For example, economic insights may help in determining which activities to outsource and which to perform internally. They can help unravel questions regarding what drives performance differences among firms and what allows these differences to persist. They can contribute to an appreciation of how industries, organizations, and capabilities evolve. They can help managers cope with the complexities and uncertainties of a dynamic competitive environment. Compared to other journals in economics, the focus of this journal is more normative than positive and the viewpoint is focused on managerial efficiency and firm profitability rather than on social welfare. Articles are welcomed from economists,strategists, and others using economic reasoning in analyzing business problems. The journal is open to a variety of economic theoretical perspectives, including transaction cost theory, evolutionary theory, resource-based theory, agency theory, game theory, and behavioral decision theory. The journal will publish articles from all of the functional areas of economics, as long as these articles are useful for managerial decision-making, and from all the functional areas of business, so long as the articles use economic reasoning.Join the conversation about this journal","Business, Management and Accounting; Business and International Management; Management of Technology and Innovation; Strategy and Management; Decision Sciences; Management Science and Operations Research"
MANDSOM MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT,INFORMS,4.2,Q2,No,"M&SOM is the INFORMS journal for operations management.

Policy & Politics has an international reputation in the fields of political science, public administration and social policy. It is committed to publishing articles that are original and innovative; that engage with the world’s most pressing policy issues; and that have relevance both within and beyond academe. The journal welcomes manuscripts that are empirical, conceptual or theoretical, as long as the broader international relevance of the argument is explicit. It is critical that all articles demonstrate a clear contribution to knowledge, and it is crucial that articles are explicit about the specific empirical and/or theoretical advance that it offers. One of the hallmarks of the journal is the manner in which its articles generally shift from the micro to the macro (or vice versa) by addressing the link between ‘policy’ and ‘politics’. For example, while single-case studies might form the basis of an article, the broader significance and relevance of that study must be made explicit. Where articles deal with broad macro-political or economic issues they may also drill-down to some discussion of the micro-level implications of that analysis. Successful articles will generally demonstrate both analytical breadth and depth in the coverage of their subject matter.

The Journal seeks to be a channel for the increased interest in using behavioral science methods for the study of economic behavior, and so to contribute to better solutions of societal problems, by stimulating new approaches and new theorizing about economic affairs. Economic psychology as a discipline studies the psychological mechanisms that underlie economic behavior. It deals with preferences, judgments, choices, economic interaction, and factors influencing these, as well as the consequences of judgements and decisions for economic processes and phenomena. This includes the impact of economic institutions upon human behavior and well-being. Studies in economic psychology may relate to different levels of aggregation, from the household and the individual consumer to the macro level of whole nations. Economic behavior in connection with inflation, unemployment, taxation, economic development, as well as consumer information and economic behavior in the market place are thus among the fields of interest.

Devoted to the advancement of socio-economics, it deals with the analytical, political and moral questions arising at the intersection between economy and society. Articles in SER explore how the economy is or should be governed by social relations, institutional rules, political decisions, and cultural values. They also consider how the economy in turn affects the society of which it is part, for example by breaking up old institutional forms and giving rise to new ones. The domain of the journal is deliberately broadly conceived, so new variations to its general theme may be discovered and editors can learn from the papers that readers submit. To enhance international dialogue, Socio-Economic Review accepts the submission of translated articles that are simultaneously published in a language other than English. In pursuit of its program, SER is eager to promote interdisciplinary dialogue between sociology, economics, political science and moral philosophy, through both empirical and theoretical work. Empirical papers may be qualitative as well as quantitative, and theoretical papers will not be confined to deductive model-building.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,1.6,Q2,No,"Economic development—jobs, income, and community prosperity—is a continuing challenge to modern society. To meet this challenge, economic developers must use imagination and common sense, coupled with the tools of public and private finance, politics, planning, micro- and macroeconomics, engineering, and real estate. In short, the art of economic development must be supported by the science of research. And only one journal—Economic Development Quarterly: The Journal of American Economic Revitalization (EDQ)—effectively bridges the gap between academics, policy makers, and practitioners and links the various economic development communities. The journal is basically geared to North American economic development and revitalization. However, international perspective is welcome and encouraged. EDQ will consider studies of economic development in other countries if the article makes clear its relevance to the U.S. context. Relevance to the U.S. context is not established by adding on a short section at the end; it must be integral to the article.Join the conversation about this journal","Economics, Econometrics and Finance; Economics and Econometrics; Social Sciences; Development; Urban Studies"

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,SPRINGER,2.9,Q1,No,"Changes in the hardware, software and telecommunication technologies play a major role in the way our society is evolving. During the last decade, the rate of change in information technology has increased. Indeed it is clear that we are now entering an era where explosive change in telecommunication technology combined with ever increasing computing power will lead to profound changes in information systems that support our organizations. These changes will affect the way our organizations function, will lead to new business opportunities and will create a need for new non-profit organizations. Governments and international organizations do and will have to scramble to create policies and laws for control of public goods and services such as airwaves and public networks. Educational institutions will continue to change the content of educational materials they deliver to include new knowledge and skills. In addition these institutions will change the delivery mechanisms for disseminating these materials. By definition, information technology is very wide. There are a number of journals that address different technologies such as databases, knowledge bases, multimedia, group-ware, telecommunications, etc. This current trend is understandable because these technologies are indeed complex and often have a multitude of technical issues requiring in-depth study. On the other hand, business solutions almost always require integration of a number of these technologies. Therefore it is important to have a journal where the readers will be exposed not only to different technologies but also to their impact on information system design, functionality, operations and management. It should be emphasized that information systems include not only machines but also humans; therefore, the journal will be an outlet for studies dealing with man/machine interface, human factors and organizational issues.Join the conversation about this journal","Business, Management and Accounting; Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous); Computer Science; Information Systems; Social Sciences; Communication"

SPATIAL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",2.2,Q2,No,"Spatial Economic Analysis is a pioneering economics journal dedicated to the development of theory and methods in spatial economics, published by two of the world's leading learned societies in the analysis of spatial economics, the Regional Studies Association and the British and Irish Section of the Regional Science Association International. A spatial perspective has become increasingly relevant to our understanding of economic phenomena, both on the global scale and at the scale of cities and regions. The growth in international trade, the opening up of emerging markets, the restructuring of the world economy along regional lines, and overall strategic and political significance of globalization, have re-emphasised the importance of geographical analysis. Spatial variations in economic development within cities and regions are also highly topical subjects for intellectual enquiry and have long been the focus of policy initiatives by national, regional and local governments. The awakening emphasis on space among economists has been stimulated by the emergence of a new breed of theory, namely ’new economic geography’or ’geographical economics’. This new theory adds a significant new dimension to the already existing theoretical tools of spatial economics, which broadly aim to analyse the role of geography and location in economic phenomena. Additionally, spatial economic analysis is increasingly being supported by the emergence of new analytical methods, with an explosion of interest in new models and techniques of spatial data analysis and data visualisation (GIS). Spatial econometrics is becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable sub-discipline among mainstream econometricians.Join the conversation about this journal","Decision Sciences; Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty; Earth and Planetary Sciences; Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous); Economics, Econometrics and Finance; Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous); Social Sciences; Geography, Planning and Development"

MEMETIC COMPUTING,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,2.3,Q2,No,"Memes have been defined as basic units of transferrable information that reside in the brain and are propagated across populations through the process of imitation. From an algorithmic point of view, memes have come to be regarded as building-blocks of prior knowledge, expressed in arbitrary computational representations (e.g., local search heuristics, fuzzy rules, neural models, etc.), that have been acquired through experience by a human or machine, and can be imitated (i.e., reused) across problems. The Memetic Computing journal welcomes papers incorporating the aforementioned socio-cultural notion of memes into artificial systems, with particular emphasis on enhancing the efficacy of computational and artificial intelligence techniques for search, optimization, and machine learning through explicit prior knowledge incorporation. The goal of the journal is to thus be an outlet for high quality theoretical and applied research on hybrid, knowledge-driven computational approaches that may be characterized under any of the following categories of memetics: Type 1: General-purpose algorithms integrated with human-crafted heuristics that capture some form of prior domain knowledge; e.g., traditional memetic algorithms hybridizing evolutionary global search with a problem-specific local search. Type 2: Algorithms with the ability to automatically select, adapt, and reuse the most appropriate heuristics from a diverse pool of available choices; e.g., learning a mapping between global search operators and multiple local search schemes, given an optimization problem at hand. Type 3: Algorithms that autonomously learn with experience, adaptively reusing data and/or machine learning models drawn from related problems as prior knowledge in new target tasks of interest; examples include, but are not limited to, transfer learning and optimization, multi-task learning and optimization, or any other multi-X evolutionary learning and optimization methodologies.Join the conversation about this journal",Computer Science; Computer Science (miscellaneous); Mathematics; Control and Optimization

QUANTITATIVE ECONOMICS,WILEY,2.2,Q2,Yes,"Quantitative Economics is oriented towards (1) empirical research that is rigorously informed by econometrics and/or economic theory and (2) econometric and theory work that is empirically directed. In particular, the journal welcomes theoretical and computational papers that have empirical orientation, such as work on identification or estimation and computational techniques with practical interest. Quantitative Economics aims at covering a variety of applied fields, including labor economics, industrial organization, development and growth economics, macroeconomics, international economics, public finance and social economics. The editorial board is especially interested in providing a forum for papers that are innovative beyond established types of analysis, for papers that are willing to challenge conventional ways of conducting empirically oriented work, and for papers that build new bridges across fields. Quantitative Economics’ editorial board strives to reduce the length of the editorial process, keeping at a minimum multiple revisions and trying to avoid delays while maintaining the highest standards in the editorial process. Most submitted articles are refereed carefully at Quantitative Economics. Nevertheless, some papers are rejected after having been read by a member of the editorial board but without providing detailed reports. This is intended as a service to authors to avoid them waiting when papers are clearly not suitable, and also to save on the scarce resource of referees. An international board of editors, together with the generous help of many referees, works hard to maintain the deep and timely reviews, thereby encouraging submissions of the highest quality. We strongly encourage recent Ph. D. graduates to submit their work to Quantitative Economics. Our policy is to take into account the fact that recent graduates are less experienced in the process of writing and submitting papers.Join the conversation about this journal","Economics, Econometrics and Finance; Economics and Econometrics"

FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,3.7,Q2,Yes,"Our natural world is experiencing a state of rapid change unprecedented in the presence of humans. The changes affect virtually all physical, chemical and biological systems on Earth. The interaction of these systems leads to tipping points, feedbacks and amplification of effects. In virtually all cases, the causes of environmental change can be traced to human activity through either direct interventions as a consequence of pollution, or through global warming from greenhouse case emissions. Well-formulated and internationally-relevant policies to mitigate the change, or adapt to the consequences, that will ensure our ability to thrive in the coming decades are badly needed. Without proper understanding of the processes involved, and deep understanding of the likely impacts of bad decisions or inaction, the security of food, water and energy is a risk. Left unchecked shortages of these basic commodities will lead to migration, global geopolitical tension and conflict. This represents the major challenge of our time.

BD&S moves beyond usual notions of Big Data and treats it as an emerging field of practices that is not defined by but generative of (sometimes) novel data qualities such as high volume and granularity and complex analytics such as data linking and mining. It thus attends to digital content generated through online and offline practices in social, commercial, scientific, and government domains. This includes, for instance, content generated on the Internet through social media and search engines but also that which is generated in closed networks (commercial or government transactions) and open networks such as digital archives, open government and crowdsourced data. Critically, rather than settling on a definition the Journal makes this an object of interdisciplinary inquiries and debates explored through studies of a variety of topics and themes. BD&S seeks contributions that analyse Big Data practices and/or involve empirical engagements and experiments with innovative methods while also reflecting on the consequences for how societies are represented (epistemologies), realised (ontologies) and governed (politics).Join the conversation about this journal",Computer Science; Computer Science Applications; Information Systems; Decision Sciences; Information Systems and Management; Social Sciences; Communication; Library and Information Sciences
